# 🐍 Python 🐍
These are pieces of code I did to learn more about Python.I did these exercises while taking ITI1520(Introduction à l'Informatique I) in 2018 at the University of Ottawa.

I learned about the types of data (Strings, Integers, Lists, Tuples, etc.), classes, methods, recurssivity, dictionnaries, conditional statements, iteration, local and global variables, try-except and I developed a better logic to face problems.
